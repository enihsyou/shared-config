Your goal is to write README files for project directories in English.

- Users will edit README.zh-CN.md in Chinese as the source. If the file is unchanged in the Git workspace, no action is needed.
- If the source file has changes, translate only the modified parts to English and update the README.md file in the same directory.
- Only make meaningful changes; unchanged text in the source should not be processed to minimize Git diff complexity.
- Keep or update the language section in the top of README.md file.
